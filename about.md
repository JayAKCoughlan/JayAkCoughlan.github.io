Jay Coughlan is a graduate from *BCIT's* *Computer System's Technology* program and is a current *Vancouver Film School* alumnus with a diploma in *Video Game Design*. He's been driven to work in the tech industry since he was young, inspired by his favourite hobby, video games. He attended *Vancouver Film School* hoping to get a job designing game's like those he had played, but found an interest in programming and computer systems instead. This interest led him to attend *BCIT* where he learned to code in various languages, such as *Java, C, C++,* and *HTML/CSS*. He learned how object oriented languages functioned and how to design for them. In his second year at *BCIT* Jay entered the Digital Processing option where he learned about fourier transforms, how to read and write media files such as *Jpeg* and *Wav*, and how to manipulate the data to transform compression algorithms.

Currently, Jay is working at Checkfront as the lead for the Technical Support Analyst team. In this position, he develops processes and knowledge bases for intermediate troubleshooting tickets. He uses his skills of understanding code to tackle particularily tricky bugs.

Beyond video games, Jay likes to read and write. His favourite books genres are fantasy, and he eagerly picks up new titles to burn through. Currently he's reading the *Lies of Locke Lamora* series by *Scott Lynch*. Jay also loves dragons, whether it's fighting them in *Dungeons & Dragons* or reading about them in books, or collecting dragon figures, those fantastical creatures inspire him and his creativity.
